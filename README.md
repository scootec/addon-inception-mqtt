Zigbee2mqtt add-on by Community Hass.io add-ons.

## About

Hass.io-addon based on the fantastic work by frenck and danielwelch.

Zigbee2mqtt bridges events and allows you to control your Zigbee devices via MQTT.
In this way you can integrate your Zigbee devices with whatever smart home
infrastructure you are using.

<!-- ## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Hass.io add-on.

1. [Add our Hass.io add-ons repository][repository] to your Hass.io instance.
1. Install the "Zigbee2mqtt" add-on
1. Start the "Zigbee2mqtt" add-on
1. Check the logs of the "Zigbee2mqtt" add-on to see it in action.

**NOTE**: Do not add this repository to Hass.io, please use:
`https://github.com/hassio-addons/repository`.

## Configuration

This addon will generate a `configuration.yaml` once upon initial start. Any
changes after initial configuration should be made in `configuration.yaml`

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

<!-- Example add-on configuration:

```json
{
    "homeassistant": true,
    "permit_join": false,
    "mqtt_base_topic": "zigbee2mqtt",
    "mqtt_server": "mqtt://homeassistant",
    "serial_port": "/dev/ttyACM0",
    "mqtt_user": "Maxwell Smart",
    "mqtt_pass": "Agent_86",
    "disable_led": true,
    "cache_state": true,
    "log_level": "info"
}
```

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warn`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`:  Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `homeassistant`

Enable or disable Home Assistant integration (MQTT discovery).

### Option: `permit_join`

Enable or disable allowing new devices to join.

### Option: `mqtt_base_topic`

MQTT base topic for zigbee2mqtt MQTT messages.

### Option: `mqtt_server`

MQTT server URL. The default should work in most instances.

### Option: `serial_port`

Serial port location of the CC2531 sniffer.

### Option: `mqtt_user`

MQTT server authentication user.

### Option: `mqtt_pass`

MQTT server authentication password.

### Option: `disable_led`

Disable LED of CC2531 USB sniffer

### Option: `cache_state`

Home Assistant requires ALL attributes to be present in ALL MQTT messages send
by the device. Should be set to `true`. -->
